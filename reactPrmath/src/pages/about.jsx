            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Courses:</strong> Start by visiting the <a href="/courses">Courses</a> page. Join a course, and once you complete it with a score of at least 60%, you'll unlock the next level of the course.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Projects:</strong> Within each course, you'll find various projects. Completing these projects will earn you points and contribute to your overall level progress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Level System:</strong> The platform features a level system where your progress is tracked based on your course and project completion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Teachers:</strong> Teachers are available to help you with your learning journey. Feel free to reach out to them for guidance and support.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Level Calculation Algorithm</h2>
            <p>
                The level calculation is based on your overall performance. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Points:</strong> You earn points for completing courses and projects. The more you achieve, the more points you gather.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bonuses:</strong> You receive additional bonus points based on how well you complete your courses and projects. These bonuses contribute to your total progress score.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Level:</strong> Your level increases as your total progress score rises. As you earn more points and bonuses, you advance to higher levels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Progress to Next Level:</strong> Your progress towards the next level is calculated based on how close you are to reaching the next milestone in the level system.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Profile Management</h2>
            <p>
                On your <a href="/profile">Profile</a> page, you can update your username, password, and email. You can also add your social media accounts to keep your profile up-to-date.
            </p>
            <h2>Rules and Guidelines</h2>
